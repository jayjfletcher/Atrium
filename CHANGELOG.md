# Release Notes

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/Refactor-Circus/Atrium/commits/main)

### Breaking

- Moved to the Refactor Circus organisation: the package is now `refactor-circus/atrium` with the PHP namespace `RefactorCircus\Atrium` (it was `jayi/atrium` and `JayI\Atrium`). Update `composer.json` requirements and `use` statements. Old class names are not kept as aliases, so stored values written under them - polymorphic `*_type` columns, audit subjects, Pennant feature names - need updating to the new names.

### Added

- Four more themes - **Sunset**, **Forest**, **Midnight** and **Ledger** - and theme layouts: `Theme::layout('top')` (or `'layout' => 'top'` in config) lays the shell out with sections across a bar under the topbar and the current section's pages as tabs beneath, as Ledger does.
- A two-level sidebar: a rail of sections (the app's own pages, then one icon per group) and a docked panel with the current section's pages. Clicking a section shows its pages without leaving the page, and hovering previews them. `NavGroup` gains `icon()` and `sort()` for its place in the rail. `Atrium::navigationSections()` lists the rail's entries.
- A per-package audit log page at `atrium.history.show` (`/atrium/history/{package}`), with filters and paging, and `Plugin::historyNavItem()` to link it from a plugin's sidebar group. History panels link to it.
- Themes: a second built-in theme, **Harbor**, beside the default **Atrium**; themes from `atrium.themes.available` and `Atrium::theme()`; and a theme switcher beside the light/dark toggle, shown behind the `atrium.themes.switcher_feature` feature (Atrium's own `Domains\Themes\Features\ThemeSwitcherFeature` by default, a Pennant feature that is on until turned off, globally or per user, once a feature resolver such as refactor-circus/pennantplus is registered).
- Shared components so the packages of the suite need no markup or styles of their own: `description-list`, `chip`, `search-input`, `flash`, `banner`, `guest`, `form.combobox`, `form.actions`, a `bare` mode for form controls, and `prefix`/`suffix` slots on `form.input`.
- History components that read the audit log through refactor-circus/keystone's `AuditTrail`: `audit-trail`, `audit.entries` and `audit.changes`. `audit-trail` renders nothing until an audit log (refactor-circus/keen) is installed.
- `Plugin::featuresFromConfig()`, `RefactorCircus\Atrium\Support\ScreenAccess` and the `AuthorizesScreens` controller trait, so a package's plugin and screens stop copying the same feature loading and policy checks.
- A safelist of layout utilities in the compiled stylesheet, and `RefactorCircus\Atrium\Testing\AtriumStyles` for checking a package's views use only Atrium's styles.

### Fixed

- A page beneath a navigation item now counts as that item's: an item on a resource's `*.index` route stays active on its `*.show` and `*.edit` pages, and a URL item on the paths beneath it. The sidebar's panel and Ledger's tabs no longer disappear on a record's own page.
- Ledger's top bar no longer has a hover menu as well as its row of tabs.
- Form controls no longer render an `id` twice when one is passed.
- `audit-trail` shows a package's history only to those its history endpoint would answer.
- `form.input` and `form.select` no longer use `null` as an array offset when no `wrapper` is passed, which PHP 8.5 deprecates.

### Changed

- Atrium now stands on [refactor-circus/keystone](https://github.com/Refactor-Circus/Keystone), the shared runtime of the suite. The `Action` base, the `ActionStartingEvent`, `ActionFinishedEvent` and `ModelLifecycleEvent` contracts and the `DispatchesModelEvents` trait moved there: import them from `RefactorCircus\Keystone\...` instead of `RefactorCircus\Atrium\...`. Atrium registers itself as the `atrium` package.
- Atrium now requires PHP 8.5. CI runs on PHP 8.5 only, and the development dependencies are raised to their latest releases (Playwright 1.64, Alpine.js 3.17.4).

### Fixed

- Opening a dashboard by its slug (`/atrium/d/{slug}`, which the dashboard switcher links to) no longer returns 404. The route parameter was bound to the dashboard model by id.
- The dashboard switcher opens toward the page instead of off its right edge, and labels shared dashboards "Shared".
- Tooltips are no longer clipped by scrolling or `overflow: hidden` containers, such as tables: the bubble is drawn on `<body>`, fixed beside its trigger, and kept inside the viewport.

### Breaking

- The source is reorganised into domain modules under `src/Domains/{Domain}` (`Access`, `Dashboard`, `Navigation`, `Plugins`, `Search`, `Settings`, `Widgets`), mirroring the `mono` application. Almost every class moved; there are no aliases for the old names, so update `use` statements, `extends`/`implements` clauses, and any class names in a published `config/atrium.php` (`middleware`, `policies`). The models are renamed `DashboardModel` and `DashboardWidgetModel`, value objects moved into `Data\`, registries into `Services\`, and model and action events now sit together in `Domains\Dashboard\Events`. `AtriumServiceProvider`, the `Atrium` class and facade, `Actions\Action`, `Http\Requests\Request`, the event contracts (`Contracts\Action*Event`, `Contracts\ModelLifecycleEvent`), `Support\Icons` and `Console\Commands\InstallCommand` keep their names. Config keys, route names, view and component names, translation keys, publish tags, table names and the `atrium.feature` middleware alias are unchanged. The models keep their old class names (`RefactorCircus\Atrium\Models\Dashboard`, `RefactorCircus\Atrium\Models\DashboardWidget`) as morph aliases, so stored polymorphic values still resolve and new rows store the same strings.

- The bundled Pennant plugin (the Feature flags page, `FeatureFlagManager`, its requests, actions and `Feature*ActionEvent` events, and the `atrium.pennant` config) moved to `refactor-circus/pennantplus` under `RefactorCircus\PennantPlus\Atrium`. Install that package to keep the page; its settings now live under `pennantplus.atrium`.
- The PHP namespace changed from `Atrium\Atrium` to `RefactorCircus\Atrium`, matching the other `refactor-circus/*` packages. Update `use` statements, the service provider and facade references, and any class names in your config (such as `atrium.php` middleware). The package name `refactor-circus/atrium`, the `atrium::` view namespace, `atrium.*` config keys, route names and `atrium-*` publish tags are unchanged.
- Event classes moved and were renamed. Model events now live in `RefactorCircus\Atrium\Events\Model` (`Events\Dashboard\DashboardCreatedEvent` is now `Events\Model\DashboardCreatedEvent`, and `Events\DashboardWidget\*` moved the same way). Action events moved from `Atrium\Atrium\Events\Actions` to `RefactorCircus\Atrium\Events\Action`. Update the `use` statements of your listeners.
- The `Atrium\Atrium\Events\Event` base class was removed. Events are now final classes implementing `Contracts\ModelLifecycleEvent`, `Contracts\ActionStartingEvent` or `Contracts\ActionFinishedEvent`.
- Model events now fire synchronously as Eloquent fires the hook, rather than after commit, so `creating`, `updating`, `saving` and `deleting` listeners can cancel a write. Action finish events still wait for the commit.
- Dashboard requests are authorized through model policies. Guests can no longer create a dashboard through `POST dashboards`.
- The `Plugin` contract gained `features()` and `navigationGroups()`. Plugins extending `RefactorCircus\Atrium\Plugins\Plugin` inherit empty defaults; classes implementing the contract directly must add both.
- Child navigation items are now filtered by their own rules. A parent without a link of its own is hidden once all of its children are.

### Added

- `Atrium::css()` and `Atrium::stylesheet()` let packages add styles to the dashboard's `<head>`, after Atrium's own stylesheet.
- `icon-button`, `icon` and `status-dot` components and the Heroicons outline set (`RefactorCircus\Atrium\Support\Icons`, extensible with `Icons::register()`), with screen conventions in the README: icon-only actions, status dots with `info` kept for pending, and navigation icons.
- Navigation gating: `NavItem::can()` and `feature()` beside `authorize()`, `NavGroup` rules for whole sidebar groups (from a plugin's `navigationGroups()` or `Atrium::navigationGroup()`), and plugin `features()` that hide a plugin and 404 its routes while a feature is off.
- `Atrium::resolvePermissionsUsing()` and `Atrium::resolveFeaturesUsing()` to plug in any permission or feature-flag system. Permissions default to the Gate; features are on until a resolver is registered.
- `atrium.feature:{features}` route middleware and `Atrium::featureEnabled()`.

- Every action now fires a start event before its work, carrying its input: `DashboardCreatingActionEvent`, `DashboardUpdatingActionEvent`, `DashboardDeletingActionEvent` and `DashboardLayoutSavingActionEvent`.
- `ModelLifecycleEvent`, `ActionStartingEvent` and `ActionFinishedEvent` contracts, to listen to a whole family of events at once. Model events expose `model()` and `hook()`.
- The `DispatchesModelEvents` trait, so an application's subclass of `Dashboard` fires the package's `Dashboard*` events.
- `DashboardPolicy` and `DashboardWidgetPolicy`, registered from the new `atrium.policies` config key. The owner of a dashboard may do anything, everyone may view a shared dashboard, and widget placements defer to their dashboard through the Gate. Every dashboard request, and the dashboard's edit controls, check them on top of the `atrium.gate` gate.

### Changed

- Visual refresh of the shell and every component: a zinc palette, an inset content panel over a new `canvas` token, and quieter buttons, inputs, cards, tables and badges.
- The sidebar collapses to an icon rail with hover labels and child flyouts, folds its groups, and expands child items in place.
- Dark mode is built in, with a light / dark / system switcher in the topbar. Search focuses with ⌘K / Ctrl K.
- Requires `laravel/framework` instead of `illuminate/support`, since the package uses form requests, events, queues and views from the framework.
