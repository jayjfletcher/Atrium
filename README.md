[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jayi/atrium.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/jayi/atrium)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/jayi/atrium.svg)](LICENSE.md)

A plug-and-play dashboard for Laravel that other packages can extend.

Atrium gives you a dashboard shell and a shared component library. Packages register a plugin and their navigation, pages, settings, widgets, and search results appear automatically. Unlike Nova, Atrium never forces your screens through a resource abstraction or a single layout. The components are the product; the shell is scaffolding you can take or leave.

## Installation

```bash
composer require jayi/atrium
php artisan atrium:install
```

Atrium denies access outside the local environment until you define its gate. Add this to a service provider:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

Gate::define('viewAtrium', fn ($user) => $user->is_admin);
```

Then visit `/atrium`.

## Writing a plugin

Generate a plugin class:

```bash
php artisan atrium:plugin BillingPlugin
```

Every method is optional. A plugin that only adds one sidebar link implements one method.

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Navigation\Data\NavItem;
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Plugins\Support\Plugin;
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Widgets\Data\WidgetDefinition;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

class BillingPlugin extends Plugin
{
    public function navigation(): array
    {
        return [
            NavItem::make('Invoices')
                ->route('atrium.billing.invoices')
                ->group('Billing')
                ->badge(fn () => Invoice::unpaid()->count()),
        ];
    }

    public function routes(): void
    {
        // Registered inside Atrium's group, so the prefix, middleware,
        // and route name prefix already apply.
        Route::get('billing/invoices', InvoiceController::class)->name('billing.invoices');
    }

    public function widgets(): array
    {
        return [
            WidgetDefinition::make('billing.revenue')
                ->label('Revenue')
                ->description('Revenue for the current month.')
                ->defaultSize(4, 2)
                ->view('billing::widgets.revenue')
                ->resolve(fn (array $settings) => ['total' => Invoice::revenue()]),
        ];
    }
}
```

### Shared plugin helpers

- `$this->featuresFromConfig('billing.atrium.features')` in `features()` returns the features listed under a config key that can be loaded, skipping feature classes whose package (such as jayi/pennantplus) is missing.
- `JayI\Atrium\Support\ScreenAccess::allows('billing', 'refund', $invoice)` asks a package's policies exactly as its JSON API and MCP tools do, honouring its `authorization` switch. Use it to hide controls.
- The `JayI\Atrium\Http\Controllers\Concerns\AuthorizesScreens` trait gives a screen controller `$this->authorizeScreen('refund', $invoice)`, which answers 403 the same way for the package the controller belongs to.

### A package's own audit log

With an audit log installed ([jayi/keen](https://github.com/jayjfletcher/Keen)), every package has its own log at `/atrium/history/{package}`: its entries, newest first, filtered by action or record. Add a link to it in your plugin's sidebar group:

```php
public function navigation(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        $this->historyNavItem('billing')->group('Billing')->sort(90),
    ];
}
```

The link and the page show only while an audit log is installed and the user may read the package's history, as its history endpoint decides. `<x-atrium::audit-trail>` panels link to the same page.

### Registering the plugin

Packages declare their plugin in `composer.json` and Atrium discovers it on install:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "atrium": {
            "plugins": ["Acme\\Billing\\BillingPlugin"]
        }
    }
}
```

Applications register their own plugins in a service provider's `boot()` method:

```php
Atrium::plugin(BillingPlugin::class);
```

Host applications stay in control. Add plugin classes to `plugins` in `config/atrium.php`, list keys under `disabled` to hide a discovered plugin, or set `discover` to `false` to turn discovery off entirely.

## Managing Pennant feature flags

The Feature flags page moved to [jayi/pennantplus](https://github.com/jayjfletcher/PennantPlus), which registers it as an Atrium plugin when both are installed.

## Widgets are offered, never placed

Returning a `WidgetDefinition` makes a widget *available* in the widget picker. It does not put it on anyone's dashboard. Only a user adding it does that.

Users keep as many dashboards as they like. Each dashboard belongs to one user, and a dashboard can be marked shared so everyone sees it. When a plugin is uninstalled, its placements are skipped rather than breaking the page.

## The component library

Components work anywhere in your application, inside the dashboard or outside it. They carry no Livewire dependency.

```blade
<x-atrium::card title="Revenue" subtitle="Last 30 days">
    <x-atrium::stat label="Total" value="$48,120" change="+12%" trend="up" />
</x-atrium::card>

<x-atrium::table striped>
    <x-slot:head>
        <x-atrium::table.row>
            <x-atrium::table.cell heading>Name</x-atrium::table.cell>
        </x-atrium::table.row>
    </x-slot:head>

    @foreach ($users as $user)
        <x-atrium::table.row>
            <x-atrium::table.cell>{{ $user->name }}</x-atrium::table.cell>
        </x-atrium::table.row>
    @endforeach
</x-atrium::table>
```

Available components:

**Layout and content**: `card`, `section`, `page-header`, `empty-state`, `stat`, `table` (with `table.row` and `table.cell`), `description-list` (with `description-list.item`), `pagination`, `breadcrumbs`, `guest` (a standalone page outside the shell)

**Controls**: `button`, `icon-button`, `icon`, `badge`, `status-dot`, `chip`, `kbd`, `avatar`, `toggle`, `tooltip`, `dropdown`, `modal`, `tabs`, `tab-panel`, `search-input`

**Feedback**: `alert`, `flash` (the session status and first error), `banner` (with `banner.button`), `progress`, `spinner`, `skeleton`

**Forms**: `form.input` (with `prefix` and `suffix` slots), `form.textarea`, `form.select`, `form.checkbox`, `form.radio`, `form.file`, `form.combobox`, `form.actions`. Pass `bare` to an input, textarea, select or checkbox for the control alone, such as in a table cell.

**History**: `audit-trail` (a package's or one record's history, from the installed audit log), `audit.entries`, `audit.changes`

### Screen conventions

Packages built on Atrium share one look, so a dashboard reads the same whichever package a screen comes from:

- **Actions are icon buttons.** `<x-atrium::icon-button icon="trash" :label="__('Delete')" variant="danger" type="submit" />` shows only the icon; the label is its accessible name and its tooltip. Tabs and back links too.
- **Statuses are dots.** `<x-atrium::status-dot variant="success" label="Active" />`, the label on hover. `info` is kept for **pending** (waiting on someone's decision); `success` done or active, `warning` held, `danger` failed or revoked, `primary` in progress, `neutral` over.
- **Navigation items have icons**: `NavItem::make('Users')->icon(Icons::svg('users'))`.
- **Only what the viewer may use is shown**: gate navigation with `can()`, `feature()` or `authorize()`, and hide each control unless its action would be allowed - asked exactly as the action asks.

Icons are the [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) outline set (MIT), by name, through `JayI\Atrium\Support\Icons::svg('users')` or `<x-atrium::icon name="users" />`. Register your own with `Icons::register('my-icon', $svg)`.

Tooltips are drawn on `<body>`, so tables and scrolling containers never clip them.

### Package styles

Atrium ships one precompiled stylesheet built from its own views plus a safelist of layout utilities (grid columns, gaps, spacing, widths, text sizes and so on; see `resources/css/atrium.css`). The packages of the jayi suite ship no stylesheet or components of their own: their screens use Atrium's components and those utilities only, and each checks it with `JayI\Atrium\Testing\AtriumStyles`:

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Testing\AtriumStyles;

it('uses only atrium styles', function (): void {
    $views = dirname(__DIR__, 2).'/resources/views';

    expect(AtriumStyles::missingClasses($views))->toBe([])
        ->and(AtriumStyles::inlineStyles($views))->toBe([]);
});
```

A third-party package may add its own styles instead. Add what you need from your service provider's `boot()`; it is emitted in the dashboard's `<head>`, after Atrium's stylesheet:

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Facades\Atrium;

Atrium::css(file_get_contents(__DIR__.'/../resources/css/atrium.css'), 'billing'); // inline, once per key
Atrium::stylesheet(asset('vendor/billing/billing.css'));                           // or a published file
```

Third-party packages may register their own Blade components too, under their own namespace.

The markup is adapted from [Penguin UI](https://www.penguinui.com) under the MIT License. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

Publish them to take ownership:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=atrium-views
```

## Using the shell for your own pages

```blade
<x-atrium::layout title="Invoices">
    <x-slot:header>
        <x-atrium::page-header title="Invoices" />
    </x-slot:header>

    Your page content.
</x-atrium::layout>
```

Every region is a slot: `brand`, `topbar`, `topbarEnd`, `breadcrumbs`, `header`, `footer`, and `sidebarFooter`.

## Theming

Atrium ships one compiled stylesheet built with Tailwind CSS 4. **No Tailwind build is required in your application** — the package compiles its own, and a host application's Tailwind setup is untouched.

Every color and radius is a design token expressed as a CSS custom property, so a theme is a set of token values applied at runtime rather than a rebuilt stylesheet. The full token list is in `resources/css/atrium.css`; `canvas` / `canvas-dark` color the area behind the sidebar and content panel.

### Themes and the theme switcher

Atrium ships two themes: **Atrium** (indigo on zinc, the default) and **Harbor** (teal on slate, with softer corners). People pick one from the switcher beside the light/dark toggle; the choice is kept in their browser and applied before paint, and each theme has its own light and dark tokens, so the two choices combine.

```php
// config/atrium.php
'themes' => [
    'default' => 'atrium',
    'switcher_feature' => 'JayI\PennantPlus\Atrium\Features\ThemeSwitcherFeature',
    'available' => [
        'sunset' => [
            'label' => 'Sunset',
            'swatch' => '#ea580c',
            'radius' => '0.5rem',
            'colors' => ['primary' => '#ea580c', 'primary-dark' => '#fb923c'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

Packages register themes in code:

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Themes\Data\Theme;
use JayI\Atrium\Facades\Atrium;

Atrium::theme(Theme::make('forest')->label('Forest')->swatch('#15803d')->colors([
    'primary' => '#15803d',
    'primary-dark' => '#4ade80',
]));
```

Set the `-dark` tokens as well as the light ones, so dark mode stays readable in your theme. Tokens a theme leaves out keep the compiled defaults.

The switcher shows only when there is more than one theme and the feature named by `switcher_feature` is on, asked through Atrium's feature resolver. With [jayi/pennantplus](https://github.com/jayjfletcher/PennantPlus) installed, that is the `ThemeSwitcherFeature` Pennant feature: on until you turn it off, globally or for particular users, from PennantPlus's feature flags screen. Without PennantPlus the class is missing and the switcher always shows; set `switcher_feature` to `null` for the same, or to a feature name of your own. While the switcher is hidden, everyone sees the default theme.

### Retuning the built-in theme

`atrium.theme` overrides tokens of the built-in `atrium` theme without defining a new one:

```php
'theme' => [
    'primary' => '#0f766e',
    'on-primary' => '#ffffff',
],
```

Dark mode follows a `dark` class on `<html>`. The topbar's appearance menu switches between light, dark and following the system, and the choice is kept in `localStorage` and applied before paint.

## Sidebar

The sidebar has two levels, so a dashboard with many packages stays readable:

- **The rail** holds one icon per section. Pages outside any group (the app's own) come first, each linking straight to its page; then one icon per group, such as each package's.
- **The docked panel** beside it lists the pages of the section you are in. Clicking another section's icon shows its pages in the panel without leaving the page; hovering an icon previews its pages in a flyout.
- The toggle at the rail's foot collapses the panel away, leaving the rail, across pages. Clicking a section opens it again. Below the `lg` breakpoint both sit in an off-canvas drawer.

Items join a section with `NavItem::group('Billing')`. Describe the group to give its section an icon and a place in the rail; otherwise it uses its first page's icon and sorts by its first page:

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Navigation\Data\NavGroup;
use JayI\Atrium\Support\Icons;

// In a plugin
public function navigationGroups(): array
{
    return [NavGroup::make('Billing')->icon(Icons::svg('banknotes'))->sort(30)];
}
```

Give nav items an `icon()` (any inline SVG); a section without one shows its initial. A page outside any group that has `children()` opens in the panel like a group, and in the panel an item with children expands in place.

### Who sees what

Navigation is filtered per request. An item, a whole group, or a whole plugin can be gated by permissions, by feature flags, or by any callback, and every rule must pass:

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Navigation\Data\NavGroup;
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Navigation\Data\NavItem;

class BillingPlugin extends Plugin
{
    // Hides the plugin's navigation, widgets, settings, and search, and
    // answers its routes with a 404, while any of these features is off.
    public function features(): array
    {
        return ['billing'];
    }

    // Rules for a whole sidebar group. The host application can describe
    // the same group with Atrium::navigationGroup() to override these.
    public function navigationGroups(): array
    {
        return [NavGroup::make('Billing admin')->can('billing.manage')];
    }

    public function navigation(): array
    {
        return [
            NavItem::make('Invoices')
                ->url('/atrium/billing/invoices')
                ->can('billing.invoices.view')            // a permission
                ->feature('billing-v2')                   // a feature flag
                ->authorize(fn (Request $request) => ...) // anything else
                ->children([
                    NavItem::make('Refunds')->url('/atrium/billing/refunds')->can('billing.refunds.view'),
                ]),
        ];
    }
}
```

Hidden children are removed from their parent, and a parent with no link of its own disappears once all of its children are hidden. A group disappears once it has no visible items.

Atrium has no feature-flag or permission system of its own; it asks resolvers you can replace, typically from a service provider:

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Facades\Atrium;

// Permissions default to Laravel's Gate. Replace them with any system.
Atrium::resolvePermissionsUsing(fn (string $ability, array $arguments, Request $request): bool =>
    $request->user()?->hasPermission($ability) ?? false);

// Until a resolver is registered every feature is on, so gating is opt-in.
Atrium::resolveFeaturesUsing(fn (string $feature, Request $request): bool =>
    Feature::for($request->user())->active($feature));
```

[jayi/pennantplus](https://github.com/jayjfletcher/pennantplus) registers a feature resolver backed by Pennant when both packages are installed. Hiding a link does not protect the page behind it: plugin routes follow the plugin's `features()`, `atrium.feature:billing,billing-v2` guards any other route the same way, and permissions still belong in your routes, requests, or policies.

To rebuild the stylesheet while working on the package itself:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:css
```

## Search

A plugin's `search()` returns a `SearchSource`, or a list of them, and the topbar's command palette queries every source the user may see. Return one source per kind of thing the plugin finds: each gets its own `results.per_source`, and classification can choose between them.

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Search\Data\SearchResult;
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Search\Data\SearchSource;

public function search(): ?SearchSource
{
    return SearchSource::make('invoices')
        ->label('Invoices')
        ->description('Invoices by number, customer, or amount.')
        ->using(fn (string $query) => Invoice::search($query)->take(5)->get()
            ->map(fn (Invoice $invoice) => SearchResult::make($invoice->number, route('atrium.billing.invoice', $invoice)))
            ->all());
}
```

Sources run concurrently, using the `Concurrency` driver in `atrium.search.concurrency` (the application's default when null). A source that throws is reported and skipped, so one broken plugin never empties the palette. With the `process` or `fork` driver each source runs outside the request: Atrium hands it the signed-in user and the request's root URL (so `route()` and `url()` link to the host the user is on, not `APP_URL`), but nothing else from the request.

Each source gets `atrium.search.timeout` seconds (5 by default), or its own `->timeout(10)`. A source still running then is stopped, reported, and left out, while the others' results are still returned. Only the `process` driver can stop a running source; with `sync` or `fork` the timeout is not enforced.

A source's closures are serialized into the child process, so they must be defined somewhere that process can autoload, such as a plugin class. Closures written inside a Pest test file are scoped to a test class that only exists in the test run, so set `atrium.search.concurrency` to `sync` in tests that register sources that way.

Without classification every source runs, so `atrium.search.concurrency_limit` caps how many run at once. The rest wait their turn: with the `process` driver the next source starts the moment a running one finishes, and with other drivers sources run in batches of that size. Null runs every source at once.

`atrium.search.results.per_source` (5) caps what one source contributes and `atrium.search.results.total` (20) caps the whole response. Set either to null for no limit.

With [laravel/ai](https://github.com/laravel/ai) installed, set `atrium.search.classification.enabled` to `true` and Atrium classifies each query against the sources' labels and descriptions (with Jev, laravel/ai's default classifier), then only runs the `atrium.search.classification.sources` (3) most likely sources, most likely first. If classification fails, every source runs.

## Events

Atrium announces everything it does, so a host application can react without patching the package. It fires two families of events, and every event uses `Dispatchable` and `SerializesModels`, so queued listeners work.

### Model events

`DashboardModel` and `DashboardWidgetModel` fire a class-based event for every Eloquent hook: `retrieved`, `creating`, `created`, `updating`, `updated`, `saving`, `saved`, `deleting`, `deleted`, and `replicating`. They live beside the models in `JayI\Atrium\Domains\Dashboard\Events` and are named `{Entity}{Hook}Event`, such as `DashboardCreatingEvent` or `DashboardWidgetDeletedEvent`. The model is a typed property (`$event->dashboard`, `$event->widget`) and is also available as `$event->model()`, alongside `$event->hook()`.

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Dashboard\Events\DashboardSavingEvent;

Event::listen(DashboardSavingEvent::class, function (DashboardSavingEvent $event) {
    $event->dashboard->name = trim($event->dashboard->name);
});
```

They fire synchronously, as Eloquent's own events do, so a `creating`, `updating`, `saving` or `deleting` listener that returns `false` stops the write. A subclass of a package model, such as your `TeamDashboard extends DashboardModel`, fires the `Dashboard*` events. The mapping comes from the `JayI\Foundation\Models\Concerns\DispatchesModelEvents` trait; entries a subclass declares on `$dispatchesEvents` win over the derived ones.

### Action events

Every action dispatches a start event before it does any work, carrying the input, and a finish event once it succeeds, carrying the result:

| Action | Start event (carries) | Finish event (carries) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CreateDashboardAction` | `DashboardCreatingActionEvent` (`data`, `owner`) | `DashboardCreatedActionEvent` (`dashboard`) |
| `UpdateDashboardAction` | `DashboardUpdatingActionEvent` (`dashboard`, `data`) | `DashboardUpdatedActionEvent` (`dashboard`) |
| `DeleteDashboardAction` | `DashboardDeletingActionEvent` (`dashboard`) | `DashboardDeletedActionEvent` (`dashboard`) |
| `SaveDashboardLayoutAction` | `DashboardLayoutSavingActionEvent` (`dashboard`, `widgets`) | `DashboardLayoutSavedActionEvent` (`dashboard`, `widgetKeys`) |

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Dashboard\Events\DashboardLayoutSavedActionEvent;

Event::listen(DashboardLayoutSavedActionEvent::class, function (DashboardLayoutSavedActionEvent $event) {
    // $event->dashboard, $event->widgetKeys
});
```

Start events fire immediately. Finish events wait for the surrounding transaction to commit (`ShouldDispatchAfterCommit`), and do not fire at all when it rolls back or the action throws.

### Listening to a whole family

Each family implements an interface in `JayI\Atrium\Contracts`, and Laravel delivers an event to listeners of the interfaces it implements:

| Interface | Receives |
| --- | --- |
| `ModelLifecycleEvent` | every model event |
| `ActionStartingEvent` | every action start |
| `ActionFinishedEvent` | every action finish |

```php
use JayI\Foundation\Contracts\ActionFinishedEvent;

Event::listen(ActionFinishedEvent::class, fn (ActionFinishedEvent $event) => Log::info(class_basename($event)));
```

Reach for action events for business side effects such as notifications and integrations. Use model events for data concerns such as auditing and derived columns. When testing, fake only the events you assert on: a bare `Event::fake()` also stops the model hook that slugs a new dashboard.

## Authorization

Access is checked in two layers:

1. **The dashboard gate.** The `Authorize` middleware checks `config('atrium.gate')` (`viewAtrium` by default) on every Atrium and plugin route.
2. **Model policies.** Every dashboard request is then checked against the policy registered for the model it touches, from `config('atrium.policies')`:

| Endpoint | Request | Ability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST dashboards` | `StoreDashboardRequest` | `create` on `DashboardModel::class` |
| `PUT dashboards/{dashboard}` | `UpdateDashboardRequest` | `update` on the dashboard |
| `DELETE dashboards/{dashboard}` | `DeleteDashboardRequest` | `delete` on the dashboard |
| `PUT dashboards/{dashboard}/layout` | `SaveDashboardLayoutRequest` | `update` on the dashboard, `delete` on each placement it replaces, and `create` on `DashboardWidgetModel::class` when it places any |

The dashboard's edit controls follow the same `update` check.

The bundled `DashboardPolicy` lets a dashboard's owner do anything, lets everyone view a shared dashboard, and refuses everything else, including guests. `DashboardWidgetPolicy` defers to the dashboard through the Gate: reading a placement needs `view` on its dashboard, changing one needs `update`. So a replacement dashboard policy governs its widgets too.

Swap a policy by pointing the model at your own class, typically one extending the bundled policy:

```php
// config/atrium.php
'policies' => [
    DashboardModel::class => App\Policies\AtriumDashboardPolicy::class,
    DashboardWidgetModel::class => DashboardWidgetPolicy::class,
],
```

```php
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Dashboard\Models\DashboardModel;
use JayI\Atrium\Domains\Dashboard\Policies\DashboardPolicy;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class AtriumDashboardPolicy extends DashboardPolicy
{
    public function update(Model $user, DashboardModel $dashboard): bool
    {
        return parent::update($user, $dashboard) || ($dashboard->is_shared && $user->is_admin);
    }
}
```

## Extending Atrium's own behavior

Atrium's writes follow the same pattern its plugins should. Requests own validation and authorization and expose their work through `persist()`; controllers only pass through. The work itself lives in an action, which announces that it is starting, wraps the write in a transaction, and announces that it finished once the write commits.

```php
$dashboard = app(CreateDashboardAction::class)->execute(['name' => 'Operations'], $user);
```

Actions expose `execute()` and keep `handle()` protected, so there is one entry point per action.

## Package layout

The code is organised into domain modules under `src/Domains/{Domain}`, namespace `JayI\Atrium\Domains\{Domain}`. Each has its own service provider, registered by `JayI\Atrium\Domains\DomainServiceProvider`, which `AtriumServiceProvider` registers in turn.

| Domain | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `Access` | `Services\Gatekeeper`, the `Concerns\Gated` trait, and the `Authorize` and `EnsureFeaturesAreEnabled` middleware (`Http\Middleware`) |
| `Dashboard` | `Models\DashboardModel` and `Models\DashboardWidgetModel`, their policies, actions, events, requests and controllers, and `Services\DashboardManager` |
| `Navigation` | `Data\NavItem`, `Data\NavGroup` and `Services\NavigationRegistry` |
| `Plugins` | The `Contracts\Plugin` contract, the `Support\Plugin` base class, `Services\PluginRegistry`, Composer discovery and the plugin commands |
| `Search` | `Data\SearchSource`, `Data\SearchResult`, `Services\SearchRegistry` and the search endpoint |
| `Settings` | `Data\SettingsPanel`, `Services\SettingsRegistry` and the settings pages |
| `Widgets` | `Data\WidgetDefinition` and `Services\WidgetRegistry` |

Package-wide pieces stay at the top level: the `Atrium` class and facade, the `Http\Requests\Request` base class, and `Support` (`Icons`, `StyleRegistry`). The `Action` base, the event contracts and the `DispatchesModelEvents` trait come from [jayi/foundation](https://github.com/jayjfletcher/Foundation), the shared runtime of the suite. Config keys, route names, view and component names, translation keys and publish tags are the same whichever domain a class lives in.

The models keep the class names they had before the move (`JayI\Atrium\Models\Dashboard`, `JayI\Atrium\Models\DashboardWidget`) as their morph aliases, so any polymorphic column or audit record that stored those names still resolves, and new records store the same values.

## Configuration

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URI the dashboard is served from. Defaults to `atrium`. |
| `domain` | Serve the dashboard from a dedicated subdomain. |
| `middleware` | The middleware stack applied to all Atrium and plugin routes. |
| `gate` | The gate ability checked before the dashboard is shown. |
| `policies` | The policy class the Gate uses for `DashboardModel` and `DashboardWidgetModel`. |
| `discover` | Whether to discover plugins from installed packages. |
| `plugins` | Plugin classes registered manually. |
| `disabled` | Plugin keys to hide. |
| `alpine` | Whether the layout loads Atrium's bundled Alpine.js. Set to `false` when the application already loads Alpine. |
| `theme` | Values emitted as CSS custom properties. |
| `search.concurrency` | The `Concurrency` driver search sources run with. Null uses the application's default. |
| `search.concurrency_limit` | The most search sources run at once when classification is not choosing them. Null for no limit. |
| `search.timeout` | Seconds a search source may run before it is stopped. Enforced by the `process` driver. |
| `search.results` | `per_source` and `total` result caps. Null for no limit. |
| `search.classification` | `enabled`, `sources` (how many of the most likely sources run, default 3), `provider`, and `model` for classifying search queries with laravel/ai. |

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `atrium:install` | Publish the config and assets, and print the gate stub. |
| `atrium:plugins` | List the plugins currently registered. |
| `atrium:plugin` | Generate a new plugin class. |

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```

Browser tests run separately, because they need Playwright:

```bash
npm install
composer test:browser
```

They drive a real Chromium against the dashboard and cover the interactions that HTTP tests cannot reach: entering edit mode, removing and resizing a widget, dragging to reorder, the widget picker, and the search palette.

To see a working dashboard locally:

```bash
composer build && composer serve
```

Every build reseeds the workbench with a demo shop through Atrium's own actions: a few users, the signed-in admin's default and second dashboards with widgets placed, and a dashboard shared by another user. Its demo plugin exercises every plugin surface, including permission- and feature-gated navigation and two search sources.
